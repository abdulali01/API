Fetching data with API

Goal of the project was to successfully pull data throught API.  In this project, Joke was pulled and displayed on the user screen.  You can referesh your screen to get a new joke.

During this effort, I pulled the https://rapidapi.com/ for reference.
Design Decision:
1. Kept it simple but to only show one joke at a time.
2. Successfully able to fetch information was the first goal.

Styling:
<div>
      <h2>Joke of the day:</h2>
      {joke && <p>{joke}</p>}
    </div>
  )
initially, it was difficult to figure API requirements and had to read alot of information.  Now working on a page where user can put in a API key, requirements field like URL to test if the API is going to pull information.

Enjoyed working on getting the information together and able to fix it.

I would like to try more API and able to present information.
